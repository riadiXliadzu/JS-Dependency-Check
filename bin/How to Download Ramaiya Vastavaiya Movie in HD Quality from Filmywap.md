## Ramaiya Vastavaiya Movie Review: A Remake of a Remake
 
Ramaiya Vastavaiya is not an original story. It is a remake of the Telugu film Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana (2005), which itself was inspired by several Bollywood films like Maine Pyar Kiya (1989) and Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya (1998). The plot revolves around Ram, a spoiled NRI who falls for Sona, a simple village girl. He follows her to her farm, where he has to prove his love and worth to her protective brother Raghuveer by working on the fields.
 
The film tries to recreate the charm and nostalgia of the 90s Bollywood romances, but fails to do so. The script is full of clichÃ©s, stereotypes and predictable twists. The characters are one-dimensional and lack depth. The comedy is forced and unfunny. The songs are average and forgettable. The action scenes are over-the-top and unrealistic.
 
The only saving grace of the film is the direction of Prabhu Deva, who manages to infuse some energy and style into the otherwise dull proceedings. He also choreographs some catchy dance numbers, especially the one featuring Jacqueline Fernandez in a cameo appearance. The cinematography and production design are also decent and capture the contrast between the urban and rural settings.
 
The performances of the cast are mixed. Shruti Haasan does a decent job as Sona, but she has nothing new to offer. She looks pretty and acts well, but she lacks the charisma and chemistry with her co-star. Girish Kumar, who makes his debut as Ram, is a huge disappointment. He overacts throughout the film and tries too hard to be cute and funny. He fails to impress as a romantic hero or a comic actor. He also looks too old for his role. Sonu Sood is good as Raghuveer, but he has done similar roles before. He brings some dignity and emotion to his character. The supporting cast is average and includes veterans like Vinod Khanna, Randhir Kapoor, Poonam Dhillon, Satish Shah and Govind Namdeo.
 
Ramaiya Vastavaiya is a film that has nothing new or original to offer. It is a stale and boring remake of a remake that does not live up to its expectations. It is only for those who are die-hard fans of Prabhu Deva or Shruti Haasan, or those who have not seen any of the films that inspired it.
